# Android
My android development work here
start with git
what is git githubb
create repo
git config to configure git into git to associate with particular user
git status to chekc status of file added, modified, or staged, untracked

next class add file and commit to remote repo 
git --version
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "email"
git clone "link"
cd <foldername> switch to current folder
git status
git add: to take the chnages to staging 
git commit: finally save the chnages to take to remote repo
cd folder name : to chnaging the folder to current path
if we run commit command wihtout staging the chnages or adding the changes , they will not be commited
only those changes are commited that are staged
commit saves the chnages in local system only not on remote
